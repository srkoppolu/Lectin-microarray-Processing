# Lectin-microarray-Processing
Repository for the automated processing of lectin microarray rawdata into a matrix form normlized data for further analysis.


This repository is used for processing the rawdata for lectin microarrays developed in Mahal Lab at New York University, NY. The scripts take input as text files from the scanner software and processes the data for quality check and normalization, finally saving the processes data as a matrix of lectins (rows) across the samples (columns). This will also save a heatmap of the final data.
